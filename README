In this exercise, we built a program that using a static library libinfi.lib we created, to
calculate the integration and the derivative of a function according to the given parameters.
We also created a Makefile that compile the while program.

The library includes one header file and one c file that contains two functions -
integration: Gets a function that gets a double as a parameter and return a double, a and b
             parameters - the lower and upper bound of the integral calculation, and n - the
             division factor. The integral calculation is based on Riemann sums.
             The assert in that function makes sure that the bounds are valid (a <= b), and that n
             is valid (n > 0).
derivative: Gets a function that gets a double as a parameter and return a double, x0 - the point
            where we want to calculate the derivative, and h - the derivative step size,
            The assert in that function makes sure that the step size is legal (h > 0).

The main c file NumericalAnalyzer.c contains all the 6 function options that we can calculate the
integration and derivative for, and the main function that checks the given arguments. If their was
an error in the arguments (number of arguments or an invalid argument) it will print an error
massage to stderr. If all the arguments were valid, it will calculate the integration and the
derivative according to the parameters, and print the result if their was no assert error.

The makefile includes all the compilation command we need to create the static "libinfi" library,
and to compile the whole program.
